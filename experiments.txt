Here are 10 laboratory experiments that can be conducted in the field of statistics:

1. **Design of Experiments**: This experiment involves designing a study to test a specific hypothesis. It includes determining the experimental units, treatments, and sampling units¹.

2. **Data Collection**: This experiment involves collecting data systematically through observation, measurement, and analysis. An example could be a clinical trial of a new drug².

3. **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)**: This experiment involves comparing the means of different groups to determine if they are significantly different from each other¹.

4. **T-Test Analysis**: This experiment involves comparing the means of two groups to determine if there is a significant difference between them³.

5. **Correlation Analysis**: This experiment involves determining the relationship between two variables.

6. **Regression Analysis**: This experiment involves predicting the value of one variable based on the value of another variable.

7. **Chi-Square Test**: This experiment involves determining if there is a significant association between two categorical variables.

8. **Factor Analysis**: This experiment involves reducing a large number of variables into a smaller number of factors.

9. **Time Series Analysis**: This experiment involves analyzing data collected over time to identify trends, cycles, and seasonal variations.

10. **Survival Analysis**: This experiment involves analyzing the time until an event occurs, such as the failure of a machine or the death of a patient in a clinical trial.

Please note that these are general categories of experiments and each category can include numerous specific experiments depending on the research question and data available.
